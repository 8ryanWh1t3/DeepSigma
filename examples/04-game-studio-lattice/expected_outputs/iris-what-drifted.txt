IRIS WHAT_DRIFTED — Game Studio Lattice
========================================

Query:   WHAT_DRIFTED
Status:  RESOLVED
Confidence: 0.91

Active Drift Signals: 4

  1. DS-GS-001 — Rating Mismatch (RED)
     Domains: CRE, REG, PLT
     Claims:  CRE-001, REG-001, PLT-001 (all Tier 0)
     Impact:  18 evidence nodes, cross-domain, cross-studio
     Patch:   Patch-GS-001 (Option C selected)

  2. DS-GS-002 — Monetization Contradiction (RED)
     Domains: MON, REG, CRE
     Claims:  MON-001, REG-002 (Tier 0), CRE-002 (Tier 0)
     Impact:  22 evidence nodes, 3-way cascade loop
     Patch:   Patch-GS-002 (regional enforcement + disclosures)

  3. DS-GS-003 — Infrastructure Cascade (RED)
     Domains: OPS, PLT, DAT, MON
     Claims:  across 4 domains (8 claims affected)
     Impact:  50 evidence nodes (shared-infrastructure group)
     Patch:   Patch-GS-003 (add independent beacons + quorum hardening)

  4. DS-GS-004 — Timezone Regression (YELLOW)
     Domains: OPS, PLT
     Claims:  OPS-001, PLT-001 (PLT Tier 0)
     Impact:  12 evidence nodes, overnight drift window
     Patch:   Patch-GS-004 (handoff checklists + regression gate)

Concentration Risk:
  shared-infrastructure correlation group: S003 + S023 feed 50 nodes across
  4 domains. Single failure cascades 18% of all evidence.

Thin-Margin Claims:
  PLT-001c (Nintendo Lotcheck): 2 evidence sources, zero quorum margin
  REG-002d (KR age-gate): 1 evidence source, zero quorum margin
