IRIS WHY — ep-gs-001 (Rating Envelope Breach)
==============================================

Query:   WHY ep-gs-001
Status:  RESOLVED
Confidence: 0.87

Summary:
  Tokyo creative director approved dismemberment VFX for RONIN "The Iron Garden"
  DLC (Source-S001, art review board). Bucharest QA compliance (Source-S009)
  flagged the content as exceeding PEGI 16 / CERO D rating envelope. The
  contradiction cascaded across three Tier 0 claims:

  - Claim-CRE-001: Franchise creative coherence — DEGRADED (91 -> 62)
  - Claim-REG-001: Regional rating compliance — FAILED (88 -> 45)
  - Claim-PLT-001: Platform certification current — DEGRADED (85 -> 68)

Provenance:
  - DLR: Publisher governance council decision (Tokyo + Bucharest + Montreal)
  - RS:  Decoupling ship date from re-rating preserves retail commitments
  - DS:  DS-GS-001, severity RED, 18 evidence nodes affected
  - MG:  2 new governance edges (art approval -> rating pre-check; descriptor
         change -> REG-001 re-evaluation)

Decision:
  Option C selected — ship DLC without dismemberment system, add post-launch
  after re-rating. Options A (VFX rework, 2-week delay) and B (accept PEGI 18,
  unknown re-rating timeline) rejected.

Credibility Index:
  Before: 83 (Minor drift)
  During: 64 (Structural degradation)
  After:  76 (Elevated risk)
