# OpenClaw Adapter (Scaffold)

Goal: route OpenClaw skill execution through Σ OVERWATCH governance.

## Intended behavior
- skill/tool call → Overwatch tool proxy
- state-changing skill → Safe Action Contract enforcement
- verification required above thresholds
- always seal DecisionEpisode + emit drift on failure

This directory is a scaffold for the adapter implementation.
