# KPI Contract: Authority Modeling

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **KPI_ID** | DS-KPI-003 |
| **KPI_VERSION** | 1.0 |
| **Status** | Active |
| **Owner** | Maintainer (DRI) |

## Intent

Validates strength of cryptographic authority controls — signing, key lifecycle, and evidence chain. Supports security posture and compliance decisions.

## Formula

```
score = manual_assessment(
    evidence=[security_metrics, authority_evidence, KEY_LIFECYCLE],
    scale=0..10
)
```

Plain-English: Manual assessment grounded in verifiable evidence artifacts. Score capped by eligibility tier if evidence files are absent.

## Inputs / Data Sources

| Input | Path | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| Security metrics | `enterprise/release_kpis/security_metrics.json` | CI artifact |
| Authority evidence | `enterprise/release_kpis/authority_evidence.json` | CI artifact |
| Key lifecycle docs | `docs/KEY_LIFECYCLE.md` | manual documentation |
| Authority ledger | authority ledger (runtime) | manual |

## Cadence

Every release — evidence files regenerated by `enterprise/scripts/export_authority_evidence.py`.

## Thresholds

| Level | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Green | score >= 7.0 | No action |
| Yellow | 7.0 > score >= 3.0 | Security review required |
| Red | score < 3.0 | Release blocked |

**Floor:** 3.0
**Max drop:** 1.0

## Failure Modes / Gaming Risks

- **False-high:** Evidence files present but stale or fabricated. Mitigated by CI regeneration and review.
- **False-low:** New authority features not yet documented in evidence files.
- **Gaming:** Committing static evidence without real key operations. Mitigated by CI verification steps.
