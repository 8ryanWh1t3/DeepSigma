# Pilot Scope (Non-Negotiable)

## This pilot is a governance + determinism pilot.
It proves mechanically reconstructable decision memory, not a finished enterprise product.

## In scope
- Repo-native DLR / Assumption / Drift / Patch workflow
- Coherence Index computation (CI) and PR gating
- A deterministic PASS->FAIL->PASS drill
- WHY-retrieval under time pressure (60 seconds)

## Out of scope (unless explicitly funded)
- Enterprise SSO / RBAC hardening
- Production-grade connectors with SLAs
- No-code integration promises

## Integration reality
Connectors are patterns + fixtures + scaffolds. Every org requires:
- data contract agreement (schemas)
- adapter configuration
- environment-specific secrets + auth decisions
