# Coherence Prompt OS v2 — Executive Brief

**One page. One decision.**

---

## What It Is

An Excel workbook that structures how your team makes, records, and self-corrects decisions. No code. No new tools. Just a shared workbook with built-in scoring, assumption tracking, and LLM-assisted triage.

---

## Why It Matters

Most institutional decisions live in email threads, chat messages, and meeting notes. When the person who made the decision leaves — the reasoning goes with them.

Prompt OS captures the **why** alongside the **what**:

- **Decisions** are logged with evidence, confidence, blast radius, and review dates
- **Assumptions** carry a half-life — they expire automatically when they go stale
- **Drift** is detected and routed to corrective patches
- **LLM sessions** are sealed and auditable

## What It Replaces

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Reasoning lost in Slack/email | Reasoning captured in Decision Log |
| "Why did we do this?" takes days | "Why retrieval" takes seconds |
| Assumptions never revisited | Assumptions auto-expire via half-life |
| Decisions made under pressure go unchecked | Compression Risk scored on every decision |
| No audit trail for AI-assisted decisions | LLM outputs sealed with hash + timestamp |

---

## KPI Targets (Pilot)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Median "why retrieval" time | ≤ 60 seconds |
| High-impact decisions logged | ≥ 50% |
| Drift → Patch cycles completed | ≥ 1 per month |

---

## How to Pilot

| | |
|---|---|
| **Team size** | 5 users |
| **Decisions** | 10 decisions minimum |
| **Duration** | 2 weeks |
| **Daily effort** | 10 minutes |
| **Weekly review** | 30 minutes |

1. Open the workbook and log your first decision
2. Add 2–3 supporting claims
3. Register key assumptions with half-life estimates
4. Run one LLM triage session per week
5. Review dashboard trends at end of each week

See [RUNBOOK_PILOT_2WEEK.md](RUNBOOK_PILOT_2WEEK.md) for the detailed checklist.

## What "Done" Looks Like

After two weeks, the team has:

- A **governed decision memory** — searchable, scored, time-stamped
- At least one completed **drift → patch cycle** — an assumption expired, was caught, and corrected
- A **dashboard trend line** showing system health over time
- A repeatable **weekly triage cadence** using LLM sessions
- Clear evidence that reasoning is being captured, not just outcomes
