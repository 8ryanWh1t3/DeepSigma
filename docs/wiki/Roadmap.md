# Roadmap

Near-term:
- Full MCP handshake implementation + schema validation
- Wire policy packs into all episode emissions
- Verifier plugins + inconclusive handling rules
- Drift fingerprints → Patch Packets (auto-generated)

Mid-term:
- Signed policy packs
- OpenTelemetry reference exporter
- Replay harness that invokes real adapters
