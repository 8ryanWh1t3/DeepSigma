# Repo Visibility Checklist

Quick actions to improve discoverability on GitHub. No code changes required.

---

## 1. Add Missing GitHub Topics

The repo already has 20 topics. The following high-value terms are **not yet present** and target the search queries evaluators and integrators actually use:

| Topic to Add | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| `ai-governance` | Primary category search term (distinct from existing `autonomy-governance`) |
| `decision-provenance` | Unique differentiator — no competing repos own this term |
| `observability` | Broader reach than existing `opentelemetry` |
| `drift-detection` | More specific than existing `drift`; matches practitioner searches |
| `llm` | High-volume generic term (existing `llm-data-model` is too specific for search) |
| `memory-graph` | Core artifact name; enables direct discovery |

**Already present (no action):** `agentic-ai`, `drift`, `coherence`, `opentelemetry`, `llm-data-model`

To add: Repo page, gear icon next to "About", Topics field, type each topic separated by spaces.

## 2. Verify Repo Description

Current description is good. Suggested refinement if you want to update:

_Institutional Decision Infrastructure — auditable decisions, drift detection, coherence scoring, and memory graphs for agentic AI._

## 3. Pin HERO_DEMO

- Go to your GitHub profile, "Customize your pins", pin DeepSigma.
- - HERO_DEMO.md is already linked from the README top nav bar (one click from landing).
