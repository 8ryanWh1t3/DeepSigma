# Language Map — LinkedIn Content → Repository Code

If you found this repository through Deep Sigma's LinkedIn content, this page maps the concepts you've read about to their implementations in code.

---

## How the Pieces Fit

```
Deep Sigma           ← brand / research program / body of work
└─ Coherence Ops     ← the operational framework (methodology)
   └─ Σ OVERWATCH    ← the runtime engine (software)
```

**Deep Sigma** is the brand. **Coherence Ops** is the framework. **Σ OVERWATCH** is the engine that executes it.

LinkedIn content primarily uses "Coherence Ops" and "Deep Sigma" language. This repository implements it as "Σ OVERWATCH" with a `core/` library.
