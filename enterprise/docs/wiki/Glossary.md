# Glossary

- **RAL**: Reality Await Layer (“await for reality”)
- **DTE**: Decision Timing Envelope (time budgets)
- **TTL/TOCTOU**: freshness gating and time-of-check/time-of-use risk
- **Safe Action Contract**: blast radius + idempotency + rollback + auth
- **DecisionEpisode**: sealed audit unit
- **DriftEvent**: structured variance/failure signal that triggers patching
- **SSI**: System Stability Index — 0-100 composite detecting unsustainable KPI swings (volatility 35%, drift acceleration 30%, authority 20%, economic 15%)
- **TEC Sensitivity**: Economic fragility analysis measuring C-TEC cost impact when RCF/CCF shift by one tier
- **Security Proof Pack**: Integrity-chain-aware security gate checking key lifecycle, crypto proof, seal chain, and contract fingerprint
- **Kill-Switch**: Stale artifact gate validating version match, radar existence, badge freshness, history, and contract fingerprint before release
- **KPI Eligibility Tier**: Evidence-based score cap — unverified (3.0), simulated (6.0), real (8.5), production (10.0)
- **Drift Acceleration**: Second derivative of KPI movements across releases; high values indicate unsustainable change velocity
- **CI-Eligible Evidence**: Benchmark output produced with `--ci-mode` that sets `kpi_eligible=true` and `evidence_level=real_workload`, uncapping telemetry-derived KPI scores from the 4.0 simulated ceiling
- **Scalability Regression Gate**: CI gate preventing throughput regressions — enforces 80% throughput floor vs. previous benchmark and requires real_workload evidence level
- **Benchmark Trend**: Historical throughput visualization from `benchmark_history.json` showing records/sec over time with 80% regression floor overlay
- **Refusal Authority**: Explicit block on a specific action type via AUTHORITY_REFUSAL ledger entry and REFUSE action contract; triggers AUTHORITY_REFUSED drift signal
- **Decision Cost Ledger**: Per-decision cost tracking derived from TEC pipeline — avg cost per decision, total cost, drift remediation delta, and patch value ratio
- **Economic Evidence**: Dedicated `economic_metrics.json` artifact with `kpi_eligible=true` sourced from TEC + benchmark data, uncapping economic_measurability KPI
- **Authority Custody**: Production signing key lifecycle — generation (`openssl rand`), env-based storage (`DEEPSIGMA_SIGNING_KEY`), 90-day rotation, revocation via authority ledger, with `signing_key_id` tracking
- **KPI Gate**: Release gate requiring all 8 KPI axes >= 7.0; satisfied as of v2.0.9 with authority_modeling at 9.72 and economic_measurability at 10.0
- **Drift Acceleration Index**: Normalized 0–1 measure of how quickly KPI movements are accelerating across releases; computed as the windowed average of second-derivative KPI deltas. Values > 0.80 indicate unsustainable velocity. v2.1.0 value: 0.68 (WARN band)
- **C-TEC**: Complexity-adjusted Time/Effort/Cost — edition-scoped variant of TEC that applies live governance factors (ICR for infrastructure coherence, PCR for PR complexity) to base hours, producing Internal, Executive, and Public Sector cost tiers
- **Evidence Source Binding**: Schema linking an evidence artifact to its originating source with provenance metadata, hash verification, and authority reference — ensures every claim traces to auditable evidence
- **Intent Mutation**: Detection of drift between the intent packet hash at episode seal time and the hash at a later replay or audit; flags unauthorized changes to decision intent as governance violations
- **FEEDS**: Federated Event Envelope Distribution Surface — a 5-stage event-driven pipeline connecting governance primitives (TS, ALS, DLR, DS, CE) via file-based pub/sub with manifest-first ingest, deterministic drift detection, authority validation, triage state machine, and canon versioning
- **Runtime Gate**: Composable pre-execution policy constraint evaluator with 5 gate types (freshness, verification, latency_slo, quota, custom expression). Returns allow/deny/degrade with machine-readable rationale. See `src/engine/runtime_gate.py`
- **SLO Circuit Breaker**: Trips when a monitored metric (e.g. P99 latency) breaches a threshold for a sustained time window, triggering automatic degradation. Resets when the metric recovers
- **Connector Auto-Instrumentation**: `@traced` decorator and `InstrumentedConnector` mixin that auto-wrap adapter methods with OTel spans. Provides per-connector operation visibility without manual instrumentation

- **DomainMode**: Base class for IntelOps, FranOps, and ReflectionOps. Provides `handle(function_id, event, context) → FunctionResult` dispatch and `replay()` for deterministic verification. See `src/core/modes/base.py`
- **FunctionResult**: Return type from every domain mode handler — contains `function_id`, `success`, `events_emitted`, `drift_signals`, `mg_updates`, `elapsed_ms`, `replay_hash` (SHA-256)
- **IntelOps**: Intelligence Operations domain mode — 12 function handlers (INTEL-F01–F12) for claim lifecycle automation: ingest, validate, drift detect, patch recommend, MG update, canon promote, authority check, evidence verify, triage, supersede, half-life, confidence recalc
- **FranOps**: Franchise Operations domain mode — 12 function handlers (FRAN-F01–F12) for canon enforcement: propose, bless, enforce, retcon assess/execute/propagate, inflation monitor, expire, supersede, scope check, drift detect, rollback

- **Cascade Engine**: Cross-domain event propagation with 7 declarative rules and depth-limited cascading. When an event in one domain triggers a rule, the target domain handler is invoked. See `src/core/modes/cascade.py`
- **Event Contracts**: Routing table mapping 36 functions + 39 events to FEEDS topics, subtypes, handler paths, required payload fields, and emitted events. See `src/core/feeds/contracts/routing_table.json`
- **Canon Workflow**: State machine for canon entry lifecycle: PROPOSED → BLESSED → ACTIVE → UNDER_REVIEW → SUPERSEDED/RETCONNED/EXPIRED. Transition validation prevents illegal state changes
- **Episode State Machine**: Episode lifecycle: PENDING → ACTIVE → SEALED → ARCHIVED. Supports FROZEN state for killswitch. `freeze_all()` halts all active episodes
- **Non-Coercion Audit Log**: Append-only, hash-chained NDJSON audit log. Each entry chains to previous via SHA-256 hash. `verify_chain()` for tamper detection. See `src/core/audit_log.py`
- **Domain Killswitch**: Emergency freeze — halts all ACTIVE episodes, emits sealed halt proof with authorization, logs to audit trail. Requires explicit authority to resume. See `src/core/killswitch.py`
- **Severity Scorer**: Centralized drift severity computation with drift-type weights, multi-signal aggregation, and GREEN/YELLOW/RED classification. See `src/core/severity.py`
- **Retcon Executor**: Impact assessment + execution for retroactive corrections: dependent claim enumeration, supersede chain, audit trail, drift signal emission. See `src/core/feeds/canon/retcon_executor.py`
- **Inflation Monitor**: Per-domain canon health monitoring — claim count, contradiction density, avg age, supersedes depth thresholds. Breaches emit `canon_inflation` drift signal. See `src/core/feeds/canon/inflation_monitor.py`
- **JRM**: Judgment Refinement Module — log-agnostic coherence engine that ingests external telemetry (Suricata EVE, Snort fast.log, Copilot agent logs), normalizes events via format-specific adapters, runs a 5-stage pipeline (Truth → Reasoning → Drift → Patch → Memory), and outputs JRM-X packet zips. See `src/core/jrm/`
- **JRM-X Packet**: Standardized 6-file zip output from the JRM pipeline: truth_snapshot.json, authority_slice.json, decision_lineage.jsonl, drift_signal.jsonl, memory_graph.json, canon_entry.json + manifest.json with SHA-256 per-file hashes. Rolling thresholds: 50k events or 25MB zip
- **JRM Adapter**: Lossless parser converting a specific log format into normalized `JRMEvent` records. Built-in adapters: Suricata EVE (JSON), Snort fast.log (regex), Copilot agent (JSONL). Malformed lines become `MALFORMED` event type with raw preserved. Pluggable via `register_adapter()`. See `src/core/jrm/adapters/`
- **JRMEvent**: Normalized event dataclass output by adapters — includes event_id, source_system, event_type, timestamp, severity, actor, object, action, confidence, evidence_hash (`sha256:<hex>`), raw_pointer, environment_id, assumptions, and raw_bytes
- **Decision Lane**: JRM reasoning classification for events: LOG_ONLY (low/info), NOTIFY (medium), QUEUE_PATCH (high + low confidence), REQUIRE_REVIEW (critical/high + high confidence). Determines routing through the coherence pipeline
- **JRM Drift Types**: Four local coherence drift types: FP_SPIKE (high-count low-confidence alerts), MISSING_MAPPING (unclaimed events), STALE_LOGIC (conflicting signature revisions), ASSUMPTION_EXPIRED (expired assumptions past half-life)
- **Cross-Env Drift Types**: Enterprise federation drift types: VERSION_SKEW (same signature, different active rev across environments), POSTURE_DIVERGENCE (confidence delta >0.3), REFINEMENT_CONFLICT (incompatible patches)
- **JRM Federation Gate**: Enterprise packet validation: manifest integrity checks, environment scope enforcement via allowlist, field redaction with recursive stripping. See `enterprise/src/deepsigma/jrm_ext/federation/gate.py`
- **JRM Federation Hub**: Multi-environment packet aggregation: ingest packets from multiple SOC environments, detect cross-env drift (VERSION_SKEW, POSTURE_DIVERGENCE), merge memory graphs, produce federation reports. See `enterprise/src/deepsigma/jrm_ext/federation/hub.py`
- **JRM Advisory Engine**: Cross-environment drift advisory workflow: publish advisories from detected drift, accept/decline with status tracking and per-drift-type recommendations. See `enterprise/src/deepsigma/jrm_ext/federation/advisory.py`
- **JRM Packet Signer**: HMAC-SHA256 manifest signing using canonical JSON serialization. Pluggable interface (subclass for KMS). Paired with PacketValidator for signature verification on ingest. See `enterprise/src/deepsigma/jrm_ext/security/`
