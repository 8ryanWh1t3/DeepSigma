# Glossary

- **RAL**: Reality Await Layer (“await for reality”)
- **DTE**: Decision Timing Envelope (time budgets)
- **TTL/TOCTOU**: freshness gating and time-of-check/time-of-use risk
- **Safe Action Contract**: blast radius + idempotency + rollback + auth
- **DecisionEpisode**: sealed audit unit
- **DriftEvent**: structured variance/failure signal that triggers patching
- **SSI**: System Stability Index — 0-100 composite detecting unsustainable KPI swings (volatility 35%, drift acceleration 30%, authority 20%, economic 15%)
- **TEC Sensitivity**: Economic fragility analysis measuring C-TEC cost impact when RCF/CCF shift by one tier
- **Security Proof Pack**: Integrity-chain-aware security gate checking key lifecycle, crypto proof, seal chain, and contract fingerprint
- **Kill-Switch**: Stale artifact gate validating version match, radar existence, badge freshness, history, and contract fingerprint before release
- **KPI Eligibility Tier**: Evidence-based score cap — unverified (3.0), simulated (6.0), real (8.5), production (10.0)
- **Drift Acceleration**: Second derivative of KPI movements across releases; high values indicate unsustainable change velocity
- **CI-Eligible Evidence**: Benchmark output produced with `--ci-mode` that sets `kpi_eligible=true` and `evidence_level=real_workload`, uncapping telemetry-derived KPI scores from the 4.0 simulated ceiling
- **Scalability Regression Gate**: CI gate preventing throughput regressions — enforces 80% throughput floor vs. previous benchmark and requires real_workload evidence level
- **Benchmark Trend**: Historical throughput visualization from `benchmark_history.json` showing records/sec over time with 80% regression floor overlay
- **Refusal Authority**: Explicit block on a specific action type via AUTHORITY_REFUSAL ledger entry and REFUSE action contract; triggers AUTHORITY_REFUSED drift signal
- **Decision Cost Ledger**: Per-decision cost tracking derived from TEC pipeline — avg cost per decision, total cost, drift remediation delta, and patch value ratio
- **Economic Evidence**: Dedicated `economic_metrics.json` artifact with `kpi_eligible=true` sourced from TEC + benchmark data, uncapping economic_measurability KPI
- **Authority Custody**: Production signing key lifecycle — generation (`openssl rand`), env-based storage (`DEEPSIGMA_SIGNING_KEY`), 90-day rotation, revocation via authority ledger, with `signing_key_id` tracking
- **KPI Gate**: Release gate requiring all 8 KPI axes >= 7.0; satisfied as of v2.0.9 with authority_modeling at 9.72 and economic_measurability at 10.0
- **Drift Acceleration Index**: Normalized 0–1 measure of how quickly KPI movements are accelerating across releases; computed as the windowed average of second-derivative KPI deltas. Values > 0.80 indicate unsustainable velocity. v2.1.0 value: 0.68 (WARN band)
- **C-TEC**: Complexity-adjusted Time/Effort/Cost — edition-scoped variant of TEC that applies live governance factors (ICR for infrastructure coherence, PCR for PR complexity) to base hours, producing Internal, Executive, and Public Sector cost tiers
- **Evidence Source Binding**: Schema linking an evidence artifact to its originating source with provenance metadata, hash verification, and authority reference — ensures every claim traces to auditable evidence
- **Intent Mutation**: Detection of drift between the intent packet hash at episode seal time and the hash at a later replay or audit; flags unauthorized changes to decision intent as governance violations
- **FEEDS**: Federated Event Envelope Distribution Surface — a 5-stage event-driven pipeline connecting governance primitives (TS, ALS, DLR, DS, CE) via file-based pub/sub with manifest-first ingest, deterministic drift detection, authority validation, triage state machine, and canon versioning
