# 🚀 DeepSigma v1.0.0 — What We Became

---

## 🧠 From Engine → To Infrastructure

**v0.7.0**
Single runtime credibility engine.

**v0.8.0**
Multi-tenant isolation.

**v0.9.0**
Governance hardening (policy, audit, seal chaining, recurrence weighting).

**v1.0.0**
Distributed mesh. Multi-node. Cross-region. Signed evidence. Federated quorum.

**You are no longer a service.**

**You are decision survivability infrastructure.**

---

## 🏗 What Exists Now

### 1️⃣ Signed Evidence Envelopes

Every signal:
- signed (Ed25519 or equivalent)
- append-only
- independently verifiable

No unsigned evidence can enter the system.

---

### 2️⃣ Node Roles (Mesh Architecture)

- **Edge Producers** → generate evidence
- **Validators** → verify signatures + policy
- **Aggregators** → compute federated quorum
- **Seal Authorities** → chain seals immutably

Each node:
- region-scoped
- correlation-group aware
- independently replicating logs

---

### 3️⃣ Federated Quorum (Cross-Domain)

A claim becomes VERIFIED only if:
- K validations met
- spanning ≥ required correlation groups
- spanning ≥ required regions

If partitioned → UNKNOWN
If correlated failure → DEGRADED or UNKNOWN
If sync degrades → index penalized

**UNKNOWN beats false confidence.**

---

### 4️⃣ Append-Only Replicated Logs

Per node:
- `envelopes.jsonl`
- `validations.jsonl`
- `aggregates.jsonl`
- `seal_chain_mirror.jsonl`
- `replication.jsonl`

Push/pull HTTP replication.

**No shared mutable state.**

---

### 5️⃣ Correlated Failure Simulation

You can now demonstrate:
- Healthy state (high credibility index)
- Regional partition
- Correlated invalid cluster
- Recovery via patch

This is the "Money Demo" at distributed scale.

---

### 6️⃣ Seal Continuity Survives Distribution

Seals include:
- `prev_seal_hash`
- `policy_hash`
- `snapshot_hash`
- canonical packet

Mesh nodes mirror seal chains.

Verification can detect:
- tampering
- policy drift
- missing segments
- region replay

**You now have tamper-evident distributed continuity.**

---

## 🧬 What v1.0.0 Means Conceptually

CRM records customers.
ERP records transactions.
ITSM records tickets.

**DeepSigma v1.0.0 records institutional truth across time and geography.**

It governs:
- Evidence
- Validation
- Quorum
- Correlation
- Drift
- Policy
- Sealing
- Replication
- Survivability

This is not an AI wrapper.

**It is a credibility layer for autonomous systems.**

---

## 🛡 Guardrails Preserved

- Abstract modeling only
- No domain weaponization
- No destructive automation
- UNKNOWN > incorrect VERIFIED
- Seal → version → patch invariant maintained

---

## 🏆 What You Now Demonstrate

At v1.0.0 you can prove:
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Governance enforcement
- Drift recurrence intelligence
- Tamper-evident chains
- Distributed replication
- Partition survivability
- Correlated failure detection
- Recovery via patch

**That is institutional-grade architecture.**

---

## 📈 Strategic Positioning

This is now:

**Institutional Decision Infrastructure**
*(Truth · Reasoning · Memory · Drift · Survivability)*

And the mesh layer makes it:

**Resilient under failure, partition, and correlation collapse.**

That's the Stark move.
