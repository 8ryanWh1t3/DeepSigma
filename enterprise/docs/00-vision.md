# Vision
Σ OVERWATCH is a **control plane** for agentic systems.

It does not replace your:
- agent framework (LangGraph/LangChain/custom),
- data platform (Foundry/lakehouse/custom),
- workflow platform (Power Platform/ServiceNow/etc).

It governs autonomy with contracts:
**DTE + Action Contract + Verification + Sealed Episodes + Drift→Patch**.
