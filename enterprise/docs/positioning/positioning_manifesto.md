# Positioning Manifesto: Decision Infrastructure

DeepSigma is not "AI governance tooling" and not "compliance software."

DeepSigma is **Decision Infrastructure**: the system layer that binds institutional intent, authority, evidence, execution, and outcomes into one reconstructable chain.

## Why This Category Exists

Most organizations can answer one of these questions, not all three:

- What did we do?
- Why did we do it?
- Can we prove the decision chain under adversarial review?

Decision Infrastructure exists to make all three answerable from sealed artifacts, not memory.

## The Operating Principle

Every consequential action must satisfy this contract:

- intent is explicit before execution
- authority is verified before execution
- logic is auditable without narrative context
- outcomes are sealed and replayable

## What We Refuse

- post-hoc storytelling as governance
- unverifiable "trust me" decisions
- score inflation without evidence eligibility
- runtime convenience that bypasses accountability

## What We Build

- intent packets and authority contracts
- pre-execution gates that fail closed
- claim -> evidence -> authority validators
- deterministic replay and sealed decision episodes
- drift-to-patch loops with measurable recovery

## Category Statement

DeepSigma is an **Institutional Accountability Engine** implemented as **Decision Infrastructure**.
