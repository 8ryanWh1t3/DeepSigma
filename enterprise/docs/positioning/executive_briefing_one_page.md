# Executive Briefing (One Page): Decision Infrastructure

## Framing

DeepSigma provides **Decision Infrastructure** for AI-enabled institutions.
It ensures decisions are accountable before execution, reconstructable after execution, and correctable over time.

## Problem

AI increases decision velocity while reducing natural accountability.
Without structural controls, organizations inherit four failure modes:

- non-replayable outcomes
- missing pre-action intent
- narrative-dependent audit logic
- execution without provable authority

## Solution

DeepSigma enforces a layered accountability model:

- Layer 0: Intent (explicit, signed, TTL-bound)
- Layer 1: Audit-neutral logic (claim/evidence/authority invariants)
- Layer 2: Pre-execution gate (fail closed)
- Layer 3: Runtime safety (monitoring, drift, observability)

## Evidence Model

- KPI claims are tier-capped by artifact eligibility
- confidence and uncertainty bands are produced per KPI
- nonlinear stability (SSI + drift acceleration) quantifies fragility
- TEC/C-TEC provides cost realism with variance bands

## Executive Value

- faster high-stakes decisions with lower governance debt
- reduced audit risk through mechanically reconstructable evidence
- shorter incident-to-recovery cycle via drift-to-patch discipline
- clearer capital allocation through quantified fragility and cost variance

## Adoption Requirement

Treat DeepSigma as infrastructure, not a dashboard.
Institutional value appears only when pre-execution gates and replayability are non-optional.
