# Pilot Scope (Non-Negotiable)

This pilot is a *governance + determinism* pilot.
It proves mechanically reconstructable decision memory under adversarial review.

## In scope
- Repo-native DLR / Assumption / Drift / Patch workflow
- Coherence Index computation (CI) and PR gating
- Deterministic PASS→FAIL→PASS drill
- WHY-retrieval under 60 seconds

## Out of scope (unless explicitly funded)
- Enterprise SSO / RBAC hardening
- Production-grade connectors w/ SLAs
- “No-code integration” promises

## Integration reality
Connectors are **patterns + fixtures + scaffolds**.
Every org still needs: data contract agreement, adapter config, secrets/auth decisions.
