# FAQ

## Is this task scheduling?
Not primarily. Schedulers decide **when** to run.
RAL decides **whether it's safe to act now** and proves it.

## Does this compete with Foundry / Power Platform / LangChain?
No. It governs them.

## What’s the smallest thing I can run?
The one-command demo: `tools/run_supervised.py`.
